    We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally
    identifiable information you may provide us through the website or mobile application.
    We have adopted this privacy policy (&laquo;Privacy
    Policy&raquo;) to explain what information may be collected on Waytous, how we use this information, and under what
    circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Waytous collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
    and servers
    typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of
    each visitor request. Waytous’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
    how Waytous’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Waytous may release non-personally-identifying
    information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>Waytous also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged
    in
    users and for users leaving comments on Waytous blog posts. Waytous only discloses logged in user and
    commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as
    described below.</p>

<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain Waytous's visitors choose to interact with Waytous in ways that require Waytous to gather
    personally-identifying information.
    The amount and type of information that Waytous gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
    transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
    acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
    advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks
    to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
    Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Waytous and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h3>Sharing your location to other parties</h3>

<p>We have no control over, and assume no
    responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>

<h3>Waytous uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h3>

    Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits. Of course,
    any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you
    can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.</p>

    may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Waytous does not disclose your
    personally-identifying information.</p>

<h3>Affiliate Disclosure</h3>
<p>This site uses affiliate links and does
    earn a commission from certain links. This does not affect your purchases or the price you may pay.</p>
