<p>Our service is pronounced "way-to-us" because it helps you and your friends to find a way to each other, whether on the road or in the concrete jungle. We offer a multi-user dynamic navigation that tracks your friend's position in real time and prompts you with the fastest route to meet.

<p>You can create a group and invite as many friends as you want to join it. Every member of the group will be able to see other's location on the map in real time.
